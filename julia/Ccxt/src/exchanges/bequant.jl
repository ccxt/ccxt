    # describe() first, then the user config — the same order, and the same
    # merge rule, as the TS base constructor (Exchange.ts, "merge constructor
    # overrides to this instance"): a plain object is deep-merged onto the
    # current value, anything else is assigned. Assigning dictionaries
    # wholesale would drop the base defaults an exchange does not restate —
    # e.g. `options.defaultNetworkCodeReplacements`, which every
    # networkIdToCode lookup needs.
    #
    # `features` is the exception, and is assigned rather than merged.
    # Julia models inheritance by composition, so a child's `parent` is a
    # fully-built instance that has already run `afterConstruct` — and
    # `featuresGenerator` rewrites `features` in place, expanding the raw
    # `{'default': ...}` / `{'swap': {'extends': ...}}` shorthand into a
    # per-market-type table and recording absent types as `nothing`. Merging
    # that derived table with the raw `describe()` value it was derived from
    # feeds the generator its own output on the child's pass: a market type
    # the parent recorded as absent comes back as a present-but-`nothing`
    # entry, which the generator then tries to index into. In TS the
    # generator only ever sees the raw value, so assign it here too.
