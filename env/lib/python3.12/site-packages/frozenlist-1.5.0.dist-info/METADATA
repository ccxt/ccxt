Introduction
------------

``frozenlist.FrozenList`` is a list-like structure which implements
``collections.abc.MutableSequence``. The list is *mutable* until ``FrozenList.freeze``
is called, after which list modifications raise ``RuntimeError``:


>>> from frozenlist import FrozenList
>>> fl = FrozenList([17, 42])
>>> fl.append('spam')
>>> fl.append('Vikings')
>>> fl
<FrozenList(frozen=False, [17, 42, 'spam', 'Vikings'])>
>>> fl.freeze()
>>> fl
<FrozenList(frozen=True, [17, 42, 'spam', 'Vikings'])>
>>> fl.frozen
True
>>> fl.append("Monty")
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  File "frozenlist/_frozenlist.pyx", line 97, in frozenlist._frozenlist.FrozenList.append
    self._check_frozen()
  File "frozenlist/_frozenlist.pyx", line 19, in frozenlist._frozenlist.FrozenList._check_frozen
    raise RuntimeError("Cannot modify frozen list.")
RuntimeError: Cannot modify frozen list.


FrozenList is also hashable, but only when frozen. Otherwise it also throws a RuntimeError:


>>> fl = FrozenList([17, 42, 'spam'])
>>> hash(fl)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  File "frozenlist/_frozenlist.pyx", line 111, in frozenlist._frozenlist.FrozenList.__hash__
    raise RuntimeError("Cannot hash unfrozen list.")
RuntimeError: Cannot hash unfrozen list.
>>> fl.freeze()
>>> hash(fl)
3713081631934410656
>>> dictionary = {fl: 'Vikings'} # frozen fl can be a dict key
>>> dictionary
{<FrozenList(frozen=True, [1, 2])>: 'Vikings'}

1.5.0 (2024-10-22)
==================

Bug fixes
---------

- An incorrect signature of the ``__class_getitem__`` class method
  has been fixed, adding a missing ``class_item`` argument under
  Python 3.8 and older.

  This change also improves the code coverage of this method that
  was previously missing -- by `@webknjaz <https://github.com/sponsors/webknjaz>`__.

Improved documentation
----------------------

- Rendered issue, PR, and commit links now lead to
  ``frozenlist``'s repo instead of ``yarl``'s repo.


  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  `#573 <https://github.com/aio-libs/frozenlist/issues/573>`__.

- On the ``Contributing docs`` page,
  a link to the ``Towncrier philosophy`` has been fixed.

  `#574 <https://github.com/aio-libs/frozenlist/issues/574>`__.


Packaging updates and notes for downstreams
-------------------------------------------

- A name of a temporary building directory now reflects
  that it's related to ``frozenlist``, not ``yarl``.


  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  `#573 <https://github.com/aio-libs/frozenlist/issues/573>`__.

- Declared Python 3.13 supported officially in the distribution package metadata.

  `#595 <https://github.com/aio-libs/frozenlist/issues/595>`__.

1.4.1 (2023-12-15)
==================

Packaging updates and notes for downstreams
-------------------------------------------

- Declared Python 3.12 and PyPy 3.8-3.10 supported officially
  in the distribution package metadata.


  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  `#553 <https://github.com/aio-libs/frozenlist/issues/553>`__.

- Replaced the packaging is replaced from an old-fashioned ``setup.py`` to an
  in-tree `PEP 517 <https://peps.python.org/pep-517>`__ build backend -- by `@webknjaz <https://github.com/sponsors/webknjaz>`__.

  Whenever the end-users or downstream packagers need to build ``frozenlist``
  from source (a Git checkout or an sdist), they may pass a ``config_settings``
  flag ``pure-python``. If this flag is not set, a C-extension will be built
  and included into the distribution.

  Here is how this can be done with ``pip``:

  .. code-block:: console

      $ python3 -m pip install . --config-settings=pure-python=

  This will also work with ``-e | --editable``.

  The same can be achieved via ``pypa/build``:

  .. code-block:: console

      $ python3 -m build --config-setting=pure-python=

  Adding ``-w | --wheel`` can force ``pypa/build`` produce a wheel from source
  directly, as opposed to building an ``sdist`` and then building from it.

  `#560 <https://github.com/aio-libs/frozenlist/issues/560>`__.


Contributor-facing changes
--------------------------

- It is now possible to request line tracing in Cython builds using the
  ``with-cython-tracing`` `PEP 517 <https://peps.python.org/pep-517>`__ config setting
  -- `@webknjaz <https://github.com/sponsors/webknjaz>`__.

  This can be used in CI and development environment to measure coverage
  on Cython modules, but is not normally useful to the end-users or
  downstream packagers.

  Here's a usage example:

  .. code-block:: console

      $ python3 -Im pip install . --config-settings=with-cython-tracing=true

  For editable installs, this setting is on by default. Otherwise, it's
  off unless requested explicitly.

  The following produces C-files required for the Cython coverage
  plugin to map the measurements back to the PYX-files:

  .. code-block:: console

      $ python -Im pip install -e .

  Alternatively, the ``FROZENLIST_CYTHON_TRACING=1`` environment variable
  can be set to do the same as the `PEP 517 <https://peps.python.org/pep-517>`__ config setting.

- Coverage collection has been implemented for the Cython modules
  -- by `@webknjaz <https://github.com/sponsors/webknjaz>`__.

  It will also be reported to Codecov from any non-release CI jobs.


  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  `#561 <https://github.com/aio-libs/frozenlist/issues/561>`__.

- A step-by-step ``Release Guide`` guide has
  been added, describing how to release *frozenlist* -- by `@webknjaz <https://github.com/sponsors/webknjaz>`__.

  This is primarily targeting the maintainers.

  authoring the changelog fragments have been published in the
  documentation -- by `@webknjaz <https://github.com/sponsors/webknjaz>`__.
