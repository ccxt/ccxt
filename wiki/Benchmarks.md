# Benchmarks

As part of our beta testing, CCXT.Pro is continuously running benchmarks against various cryptocurrency exchanges to ensure stability and proper functionality. We maintain a real-time monitoring dashboard that tracks:

- WebSocket connection stability
- Message processing performance
- Connection latency
- Reconnection rates
- System resource usage

## Live Dashboard

The dashboard provides insights into ccxt.pro performance across different exchanges and helps us maintain high reliability standards.

## Metrics Tracked

- WebSocket connection duration
- Messages received per exchange
- Processing time per message
- Disconnect events
- Session durations
- System metrics (CPU, Memory)

These metrics are collected for both TypeScript and Python implementations, allowing us to ensure consistent performance across language implementations.
