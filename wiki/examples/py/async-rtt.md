# WARNING!
# This example measures the round-trip time when placing orders with an exchange
# In order to measure the speed of requests it disables the rate-limiting
# Disabling the rate-limiter is required to do an accurate measurement
# If you keep running without a rate limiter for a long time the exchange will ban you
# In a live production system always use either the built-in rate limiter or make your own
