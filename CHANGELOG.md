# [4.0.3](https://github.com/ccxt/ccxt/releases/tag/4.0.3) - 2023-07-01

We are happy to announce the release of CCXT version 4!

During the last months we have been working hard on a few major improvements to the library adding important upgrades, including:

* the merge of CCXT Pro Websocket APIs with the master repository of CCXT
* the ESM and TypeScript migration for type-safety and portability
* AST-based transpilation to support popular programming languages like C#
* unification of perpetual swaps and futures markets among the leading exchanges like Binance and BitMEX
* adding Bybit v3 and v5 APIs support
* cryptocom v1 upgrades
* per-exchange class method specifications: https://docs.ccxt.com/#/spec
* unified proxy support
* and many many more fixes and unifications


We highly recommend downloading and installing the most recent release of CCXT version 4.0.3+ in order to get a much smoother experience for your trading operations.
